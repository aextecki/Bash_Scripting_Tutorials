#For loop:
#The for loop is used when you want to repeat a block of code a known number of times. Instead of
#checking a condition, it iterates over a sequence of values.
#Analogy:
#Think of the `for loop` as an car assembly line. You have to put some parts. 
#take it one car at a time, test it, and then move on to the next. You keep doing this until you've
#finish all the car in a day.
